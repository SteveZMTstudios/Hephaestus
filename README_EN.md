# Hephaestus
A tool that make repairing school teaching computer easier.


# Install
[Bootable USB installer (Chinese Simpfiled) -Release](https://github.com/SteveZMTstudios/Hephaestus/releases)
<br>Sorry but now we didn't compiled an English version. If you want a version that English, you can translate it in source code or just sponsor this project.

# Build
This program is running on Python script directly.

# How the idea is implemented 
~~By using a centralized installation package (generated by the management system) to install it on the computers of each classroom, and at the same time create a supporting ISO image to realize that the computers that are not joined to the configuration group can temporarily and easily obtain the system installation image of the intranet storage; the centralized installation package can create a boot item, when the operating system is damaged to a mild degree, reboot to the image only send an email to the administrator and automatically download the ISO deployed on the school intranet server, and pop up a friendly loading box when the download is completed, or use tinytask to automatically enter the ordinary windows repair without operationWhen the operating system is so badly damaged that it can only boot to PE, WinPE will deploy a temporary environment for teachers to use basic PPT projection functions, word and excel editing, whiteboard and kiosk functions; at the same time, the installer will automatically run the Windows installer in the background and send an email; when the Windows reinstallation is completed, a window will pop up to inform the teacher and the audio-visual education committee that the computer can be restarted when it is idle.~~
<br> ~~The ISO image installed for the classroom can be customized, pre-installed with some necessary files (such as office, SEWO teaching suite, etc.), or it can be customized by the administrator when configuring the system.~~

~~The installation package installed on each computer only implements a few functions: by obtaining the URL already written in the installation package, obtaining the WinPE and custom Windows installation image link and administrator email, they will be stored in the C:WindowsHephaestus folder, and the system startup items will be registered.~~

What the administrator's installer needs to do:
~~1. Configure the server locally or use an existing intranet server as a CDN to distribute urls, so you need to do a good job of IP fixation~~
~~2. Set the server script to start automatically at boot, which may slow down the boot speed, so it is recommended to use the server configured with NAS in the school directly;~~
~~3. Fill in the email address of the administrator~~
~~4. Pre-installed program for custom Windows installer ~~
~~5. Configure how Winpe works, including whether to allow formatting the entire disk and reinstalling the operating system as a last resort~~
6. Make  ~~classroom computer installation package and~~ bootable USB flash drive
~~7. Collect the startup status of winpe in each class, and if there is a centralized startup, the email will report that the administrator may have a malignant virus spreading or that Windows has installed an abnormal update. ~~
<br>*Due to the limited development cycle, the program now only develops a USB installer and a WinPE kernel image as well as the integration of the necessary drivers and optional software. If I have time, I'll make up for this project. Maybe after June.*


# The source of the idea 
In November 2023, there were a large number of crashes and non-booting problems on the electronic whiteboard all-in-one machine in our school classroom, and the network management was really busy at that time, so some class teachers turned to Aokiri S. and me for help. This process is very boring and tedious, and delays the progress of the class, some classes because of the use of the built-in recovery operating system tool caused a serious teaching accident, so the plan to write this program.。
